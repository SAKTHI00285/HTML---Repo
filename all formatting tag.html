    <h1>PHOTOSHOP CC</h1>
    <P>Adobe Photoshop is a raster graphics editor developed and published by Adobe Inc. for Windows and macOS.<b> It was originally created in 1987 by Thomas and John Knoll. Since then, the software has become the most used tool for professional digital art, especially in raster graphics editing. </b>The software's name is often colloquially used as a verb (e.g. "to photoshop an image", "photoshopping", and "photoshop contest"although Adobe discourages such use.

        Photoshop can edit and compose raster images in multiple layers and supports masks, alpha compositing and several color models. Photoshop uses its own <strong> and PSB file formats to support these features. In addition to raster graphics, Photoshop has limited abilities to edit or render text and vector graphics</strong> (especially through clipping path for the latter), <i>as well as 3D graphics and video. Its feature set can be expanded by plug-ins; programs developed and distributed</i> independently of Photoshop that run inside it and offer new or enhanced features.
        
        Photoshop's naming scheme was initially<small> based on version numbers. However, in October 2002 (following the introduction of Creative Suite branding), each new version </small>of Photoshop was designated with "CS" plus a number; e.g., the eighth major version of Photoshop was Photoshop CS and the ninth was Photoshop CS2. Photoshop CS3 through CS6 were also distributed in two different editions: Standard and Extended. With the introduction of the Creative Cloud branding in June 2013 (and in turn, the change of the "CS" suffix to "CC"), Photoshop's licensing scheme was changed to that of software as a service subscription model. Historically, Photoshop was bundled with additional software such as Adobe ImageReady, Adobe Fireworks, Adobe Bridge, Adobe Device Central and Adobe Camera RAW.

         From the beginning, Photoshop could save files in other formats,<del> including TIF, JPEG, and GIF. These files are smaller than PSD files because they lack the editable features of a PSD file. </del>These formats are required to use the file in publications or on the web. Adobe's discontinued program PageMaker required TIF format.

Photoshop can also create <ins>and use files with the extension .PSB, which stands for "Photoshop Big" (also known as "large document format").[21] A PSB file extends the PSD file format, increasing the maximum height and width to 300,000 pixels and the length limit to around 4 Exabytes. </ins>The dimension limit was apparently chosen arbitrarily by Adobe, not based on computer arithmetic constraints (a+b)=a<sup>2</sup>b<sup>2</sup>=a<sup>2+b<sup>2</sup>(it is not close to a power of two, as is 30,000) but for ease of software testing. PSD and PSB formats are documented.[22]

Because of Photoshop's popularity, <strong><sub>3</sub>2<sub>b</sub>=a<sub>2</sub>b<sub>2</sub></strong>PSD files are widely used and supported to some extent by most competing software, including GIMP and Affinity Photo. The .PSD file format can be exported to and from Adobe's other apps, such as Adobe Illustrator, Adobe Premiere Pro, and After Effects.
