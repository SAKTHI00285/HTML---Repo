<h1>SATELITE</h1>
<h2>how to satelite</h2>
<body>
    <p>A satellite is an object in space that orbits or circles around a bigger object. <br>There are two kinds of satellites: natural (such as the moon orbiting the Earth) or artificial (such as the International Space Station orbiting the Earth).<br>
        Artificial satellites, however, did not become a reality until the mid-20th century. <mark>The first artificial satellite was Sputnik, a Russian beach-ball-size space probe that lifted off on Oct. 4, 1957. </mark>That act shocked much of the western world, as it was believed the Soviets did not have the capability to send satellites into space.<hr>
