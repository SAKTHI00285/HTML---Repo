       <h1>two&four wheeler technology</h1>
       <p>The English word car is believed to originate from Latin carrus/carrum "wheeled vehicle" or (via Old North French) Middle English carre "two-wheeled cart", both of which in turn derive from Gaulish karros "chariot".It originally referred to any wheeled horse-drawn vehicle, such as a cart, carriage, or wagon.<hr>
       The two wheels may be arranged in tandem, one behind the other, as with single-track vehicles, or arranged and also side by side, on the same axle. If on the same axle, the vehicle may have no other support, as with dicycles, or have additional support, which is often also the source of motive power.<hr>
